                	<p><strong>Abstraction: </strong> Language often has special cases. In English, the plurals ofsome nouns add  <em>s</em>;  some   add  <em>es</em>;  nouns like <em>calf</em> and <em>fly</em> become <em>calves</em> and <em>flies</em>, changing their final letters before adding <em>es</em>. And more. For a programming task this complex, it's (generally) best to break it into parts, handle each part separately with its own procedure (its own block), and then have the "top-level" block—in this case, <code>plural</code>, itself—use those specialists. That is, instead of coding every little detail directly in <code>plural</code>, it is cleaner and clearer to make <code>plural</code> look something like this.</p>

                    <p>Showing<a name="abstraction" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>the <em>structure</em> of the method—just the overall strategy—in the "top-level" block and leaving the details to  separate blocks is one part of an important computer science idea called <strong>abstraction</strong>. Abstraction keeps your code clear, readable, and more easily debugged. It will also help your code be more flexible. </p>

				<li> When you trust your new specialist block, edit <code> plural</code> to use the specialist. Test (you can use <code>map</code>) to make sure <code>plural</code> still works for all the words it used to work for, as well as the new ones.</li>
				<li> Create <code>plural-y</code> to handle words like 
<<<<<<< HEAD
					<img src="../../afb/"> and
					<img src="../../afb/">

				<p>Remember, any specialist can make mistakes if it's asked to do a job that isn't its  specialty. <img src="../../afb/"> </p>
				<p>Make sure  <code>plural</code> gives it only the job it knows how to handle correctly.</p>
