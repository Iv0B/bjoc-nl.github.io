        	<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will consider some of the legal history of copyrights.</p>
        </div>

    	<p>Here's the US Constitution (Article 1, Section 8) on copyrights and patents:</p>
        <div class="takeNote"><big>The Congress shall have Power [...] To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries; [...]</big></div>
        <p>Pay special attention to the part about "for limited Times." Despite the "right" in the name "copyright," copyrights aren't <em>rights</em> the way freedom of speech, or even owning a house and the land underneath it, are rights.  In the case of homes, an owner can pass the right of ownership on to her children, grandchildren, and so on forever.  But copyrights and patents are in force only for a limited time.</p>
        <p>Over the past 50 years or so, Congress has repeatedly extended the duration of copyrights. Critics note that these extensions have come just as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steamboat_Willie#Copyright_status" target="_blank" >the first Mickey Mouse cartoon</a> was about to pass out of copyright. Although all concerned say this is a coincidence, the Disney company has become a sort of poster child for abuse of copyrights.  Ironically, many of the Disney cartoons (Snow White, Cinderella, etc.) are based on stories that are in the public domain (okay for anyone to use), but would still be under copyright if today's copyright law had been in effect when earlier versions were written.</p>
        <p>Why did the writers of the Constitution include provisions for copyrights (and patents)? What they had in mind was not an absolute property right, but rather a <em>bargain</em> in which society lets authors and inventors make a lot of money from their ideas, but in return those ideas must eventually belong to the entire society, free for anyone to use.</p>
   <!--     <p>Protecting the openness of ideas is particularly important for patents. Before there were patents on inventions, inventors used <em>secrecy</em> to protect their ideas, and so the knowledge of how to use the invention often disappeared after the inventor's death.  This has happened repeatedly throughout history; an interesting example is that several colors of paint were unavailable for long periods of time until they were reinvented.  But the most famous example is Antonio Stradivari (1644-1737), an Italian violin maker generally considered to have been the greatest maker of string instruments of all time. Nobody in modern times has been able to create comparable instruments, according to violinists, although blind listening tests seem to show that the musicians can't really tell the difference between a "Strad" and another high-quality violin. Stravivari never published his techniques, but perhaps he would have in return for patent protection, if that had existed in his time. (Today you can buy one of the 500 or so Strads still in existence for about $2 million to $3 million.)</p>

            <p>Heb je ooit een verjaardag gevierd bij een restaurant? Het is heel gewoonlijk dat wanneer ze de
                verjaardagstaart naar je toe brengen, alle bediendes om je tafel gaan staan en "Happy Birthday" zingen.
                Dit was echter tot voor kort <em>illegaal</em>; Warner/Chappell Music heeft namelijk het auteursrecht,
                gebaseerd op het originele eigendom van het lied met dezelfde melodie maar met andere tekst door de
                zusters Patty en Mildred Hill uit 1893 (meer dan een eeuw geleden).
                De beslissing van een rechter in 2015 heeft dit auteursrecht ongeldig verklaard, maar er kan in
                beroep worden gegaan door Warner, die ongeveer $2 miljoen per jaar verdiende aan boetes voor het gebruik
                van het lied, vooral in films.
