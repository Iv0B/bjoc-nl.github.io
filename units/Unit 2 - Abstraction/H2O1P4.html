		<h2>Modeling Language: Plurals, Part 1</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <p>We discussed moving the TIF up to the top before the FYTD--something like: You can do this whole project in any language you want (your native language or one you are learning.) --MF, 5/22/18</p>
            <p>There are some images that need attention on this page. --MF, 6/6/18</p>

            Siri and other robots are programmed to  generate  language. Siri speaks; some robots write. You have  developed a program, <code>gossip</code>, that writes. Now, you can extend  the computer's abilities with language by developing a reporter block, <code>plural</code>, that takes a noun as input and correctly spells and outputs the plural. <br />
